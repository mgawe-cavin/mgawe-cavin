- 👋 Hi, I’m mgawe-cavin
- I am a research student at Institute of Primate research (IPR), my work is mainly focused on developing a simplified and more sensitive LAMP kit for malaria diagnosis. I joined GitakaLab at Mount Kenya University in November 2021 as a visiting student to expound on my molecular skills and experience especially on rapid molecular diagnostic approaches.Through this lab, I have acquired new knowledge on Identical Multi-repeats sequence (IMRS) technology approach in developing rapid diagnostic molecular assays.In addition, I'm also involved in a study on environmental surveillance of SARS-COV2 in waste water at GitakaLab in Mount Kenya University
- 👀 Recently, I was awarded RSTMH early career research grant to support my work which is focusing on developing simplified and sensitive LAMP kit for malaria diagnosis.
- 🌱 I’m currently undergoing training and mentorship as OLS-5 cohort - mentee and project lead and also learning to get better at R programming 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data visualization of PCA of Plasmodium falciparum Pfr364 repeats using R programming language
